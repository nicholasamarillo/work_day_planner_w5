# work_day_planner_w5
DESCRIPTION:

This application is a Work Day Planner. The purpose of this application is to be able to add daily tasks in a certain time slot and be able to reference it whenever you want using local storage. 

FEATURES:

You'll have a text area where you can add your tasks and a save button to save the information inputed to local storage. The application will also change the appearence of past, present, and futue times in the day so you know what things you are supposed to do at that time.

TESTS:

To test this application:

1. Go to any time block and input some text, then hit save.
2. Hit refresh on the page to see if the local storage is working as it should be.
3. See if the time periods are color coordinated to indicate current time, past time, and future time.
4. Delete the text from the box and then hit save. Refresh the page and see if the local storage has been cleared from that time block.

If all tests are passed then HURRAY!!!
